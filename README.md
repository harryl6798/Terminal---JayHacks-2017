Why hello there.
Welcome to "Terminal", a two-player interactive puzzle platform game that involves one user accessing the keyboard, and another user utilizing a controller.

The purpose and inspiration behind "Terminal" was to have an interactive two-player game that distinguishes itself from traditional two-player logic. Rather than having two players control
a character for themselves, one player actively controls the "level" to support the "playing" player. The fundamental purpose behind this functionality was so that the players could work
on teamwork, because they can only succeed by working with each other. 

"Terminal" started off as a hacking and infiltration game, but after several variations of changes, we decided to leave the industrial infiltration idea behind and continue with the idea of a
co-op compelete a level idea, loosely based on Mario. With more time we will expand to a story line, and probably incorporate further abilities and levels.

Basic Controls:
Playing as Charater:
To Move - Joystick
To Jump - Button (A)
Playing as keyboard:
To Control the Stage - Type Keywords hidden in the level


We hope you enjoy our game, because we know we had a fun time coding it.
